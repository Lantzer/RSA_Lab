# CSCD434 Network Security - RSA Encryption Lab

I implemented an RSA encryption algorithm, demonstrating how increasing the size of the prime factors used to compute `n` (where `n = p * q`) exponentially increases the difficulty of factoring `n`, and thus enhances the security of the encryption.

To implement RSA encryption I had to:
- Generate `p` and `q`
